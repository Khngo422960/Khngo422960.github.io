## Favorate CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 9, Part 2

    This project is one of my favorites because returning to if/ofstream was something I considered exploring, especially when dealing with file creation. This lab supplemented my ability to use a library to create, write and read files on my computer. File creation is something i am still using especially with folders and small executables such as macros for some of my daily activities.

* Lab 6, Part 2

    Shocker, I know. Counterpoint? Blackjack is fun, with or without bets. The few times where I lucked my way into an instant win is both comical and euphoric. Using boolean functions is something I am no stranger to, only exception being using multiple booleans to differentiate the type of card and its score. What actually mesmerized Me was actually not only using the command line as an input but also the conversion from string to integer which was something I was not aware of at the time.

* Lab 10

    This lab was something I hated for all the wrong reasons. Retrospectively, It helped me gain a good perspecting when understanding 2-D vectors and how to navigate around them. It also helped me explain the capacity of computers to parse through large amounts of information that would normally take humans hours, possibly days to figure out relevant information.
